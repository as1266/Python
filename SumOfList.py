# 5: Assume you have the assignment numbers = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
# (a) Write a loop that adds all the numbers from the list into a variable called total.
#You should set the total variable to have the value 0 before you start adding them up, and print the value in total after the loop has completed.
# (b) Â Print the product of all the numbers in the list. (product means all multiplied together)

numbers = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
total = 0

for i in numbers:
    total = i + total
print(total)

total = 1

for i in numbers:
    total = i * total
